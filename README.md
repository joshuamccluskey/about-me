# LAB - 2

## about-me

As a user, I would like to learn about the site owner so I can get to know them better..

Create an About Me guessing game that utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

Include on your HTML page a short biography, your education history, an overview of your job experience, and any goals that you may have.

Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user input for the answer must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while taking into consideration case sensitivity by normalizing the user input so that it can be validated (hint: look into the `.toUpperCase()` or `.toLowerCase()` functions). Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting them with a response.

Add `console.log()` messages within your app to notify the user if they are correct. Before submitting, comment out (don’t delete) your `console.log()` messages and replace them with the `alerts()` to complete the project.

As a user, I would like a personalized welcome message so that I feel like I am interacting with the site owner.

Ask the user their name through a `prompt()`

Display that name back to the user through a custom greeting welcoming them to your site.

Display the user’s name back to them in your final message to the user.

Developer Style Guide
A style guide is a series of standards and practices that must be followed in order for your code to be accepted by the team. This can include variable naming, file structure, and process. Below is a list of practices that you will be required to follow within this lab:

Your JS file must contain a `'use strict';` declaration at the top, and your javascript file must be linked in your html file as an external script file.

Make sure that all code is cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. Look at examples online and in your textbook. Note that your JS must pass the rules in the linter that we installed.

Follow the Add, Commit, Push process. It should be evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.

### Reflections and Comments

Once I had my JS working, I spent most of my time playing around with the CSS. I was mostly working on having a healthy balance of working and taking breaks. I took a 5 minute break every 25 minutes. I felt like I accomplished more working in rounds like "time boxing"
“[Adult learners] are deeply involved not only in planning, but also in evaluating their learning, as they know what knowledge they want to acquire.”

As I reflect on the quote, it's clear that adult learning is more efficient, due to planning and evaluating throughout the learning process. It's clear that andragogy is a more introspective and agile process that is more self directed. Whereas in pedagogy, the learner is directed to do as they are by a teacher. Motivation is essential in the process that keeps the learner engaged. For adults, it can be intrinsic or extrinsic, but ultimately, the motivation comes down to personal need or want.
As a learner of foreign languages, I find that its easier to learn a language through understanding the mechanics of the English language. From there I can take a systematic approach. As I build a greater understanding, I can evolve and iterate on what I know. "I say" turns into  "I said" because I need to refer to the past. Then it turns into "I should have read" to imply some kind of need to read. Then it turns into
"I should've read" to sound more fluent. As an adult learner I can learn foreign languages more efficiently because I know I what I need or want to learn.

I find that myself following a very similar approach in  learning here at Code Fellows. First we are shown the most basic technique and then we iterate upon it after having a greater understanding and make the concept easier or more useful or it could be more efficient.  Whenever I learn something new like a trick in the command line that makes my life easier it sticks with me more rather than if I was just shown it right away. It only takes once for that to stick with me, but it has a greater impact because it stems from an experience in the past of doing a longer and harder way.

In a way, the more I learn the more motivated I get because I know exactly what I want or need to learn as I progress. If a problem presents itself I see it as a lesson that I will work thoroughly and bear a lot of fruit from going through and experiencing that process. I fully agree with the style and approach that Code Fellows takes on learning.

I need to do the task. I need to remember how it felt doing the task. I need to then look back, and see what I could've done better or more quickly. I need to feel the value in the process, so I can continue and stay motivated to repeat the process again. I am intrinsically motivated in the process, because I become more confident, and I can take that confidence and use it in other areas of my life.

# LAB - 3

Continue to build off of your lab 02 by adding additonal functionality to your About Me Guessing Game. Work in the same repository as you did for Lab 2, and modify your README.md file to describe your project with the new features you are adding.

As a user, I would like to view a series of data related to the site owners interest so that the I can quickly view more information about them.
Create a “Top Ten” at the bottom of your HTML page as an ordered list in HTML. Some ideas that you can include could be top ten movies, top ten favorite places, or top ten places to visit. You may choose to do whatever top ten list that you wish.
Convert your work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML
As a user, I would like to be guided to an answer through a series of feedback responses so that I can learn more about the site owner.
Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.
As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities so that I can have fun with with a guessing game.
Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.
As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.
Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.
In addition to the user stories stated above, continue to use console.logs throughout the code to track the questions that are being asked to the user, and add addtional CSS to style your HTML page.

Stay within scope of what was taught so far in class. Do not write functions within your application. Avoid the use of “helper” methods such as `.includes()` and `.join()`. Work with the instructional staff directly if you have questions about this requirement.

Stretch Goals
After completing all of the requirements listed above, you may optionally challenge yourself further by implementing some or all of the following into your application.

Attempt to make your code more DRY by putting all of the questions, answers, and responses to the first five yes/no questions into arrays (or even one huge multidimensional array), and modifying the game logic such that a ‘for’ loop will control the flow from question to question.
Make the number-guessing question use a random number as its correct answer.

### Reflections and Comments

The more I can associate with concepts or techniques before and iterate upon what I’ve learned or have built, the more likely I will retain that information after seeing it once. It is the ability to take my previous experience and to turn those learning experiences into impactful moments of learning. The more impactful those moments are the more likely I will only have to see once. The adult learner has an advantage because the adult learner understands what they need to learn.

Thisweek, I learnt some many hot keys that I thought were not  only cool, but I knew from that moment forward that this was what I needed and didn’t know it until that moment. The structure of the class has facilitated those moments of almost like a mixture of self discovery with a directed approach. Those moments are so exciting, it boosts my motivation. The string literal lesson was an impactful lesson. Concanting strings and variables is a long process and can cause errors if you forget a quotation mark or ‘+’. The string literal allows you more freedom to type with a less likelihood you code will break.

I’m excited to see how far I can push myself during various and more complex loop  build outs. The more and more I actually build and get into that mindset, the more likely that way of thinking will become quicker. I need to charge on and keep going. I feel really positive and motivated at the moment. I would say moving forward into future concepts and more complex concepts will boost my confidence and further motivate me to want to learn more. I’m intrinsically motivated to learn more. Let's see how far I can push myself with Loops.

# LAB - 4

1. How To Get Code Ready For Work
Be sure to follow these instructions VERY carefully.

Note: Before starting these steps, make sure that both of your repositories are ‘clean’: in other words, everything is committed and pushed so that both the remote and local versions of your projects are in sync. This will prevent potential problems later.

Decide whose code you will work on first. The owner of that code (who will be the Navigator) provides the link to their GitHub repo to the other member of the pair (who will be the Driver). You can send this link over Slack.

The Driver follows the link to that repo and creates a fork of the repo in GitHub like we did in class.

The Driver then goes to their fork of the repo (the URL should have the Driver’s GitHub name in it) and copies the link to that repo (the link have the Driver’s GitHub name in it and should end in .git).

Inside of the Driver’s main work directory on their laptop, make a directory with your partner’s name and then navigate (cd) into it. From there, enter the command git clone the-link-you-copied. That will create a local version of the forked repo on the Driver’s laptop.

cd into that directory and enter code . in the terminal to open all of the files in VSCode.

Start working on the code!

2. Extend and Refine
You’ll be making some edits to each other’s sites. After each bit of work is completed (in other words, after each successful modification of a single question), be sure to do an add-commit-push cycle (a-c-p) to place the code on GitHub and preserve a versioned history of your work.

Move the logic for all questions into functions: Today we learned about functions, and now we’ll move the logic for the individual questions into separate functions, and call those functions to run the game.

In its most basic sense, this is pretty simple and straightforward: ‘wrap’ the logic and variables for a given question with function someFuncNameYouChoose() { at the beginning, and add a closing curly brace } at the end. To make the function execute, just call it afterwards: someFuncNameYouChoose(); After completing this step the game should behave exactly as it did before. a-c-p

Update the README file: In the README file, add in the names of the Driver and Navigator and indicate that the code was worked on together. This is basic record-keeping so that you can keep up with how the code has been edited in a user-friendly format. a-c-p

3. Push to GitHub; Make a Pull Request
Once everything is finished, and the Driver has done the last edits and pushed them to GitHub, it’s time to send the edited code to the owner (who has been in the Navigator role the whole time, of course). We do this with a GitHub feature called a Pull Request, which we generally refer to as a PR.

From the Driver’s repo that is a fork of the Navigator’s repo, hit the green button that says ‘Create pull request’.

Follow the remaining steps as described onscreen and as shown here: <https://help.GitHub.com/articles/using-pull-requests>. (These instructions for doing a pull request from a forked repo to its source are deliberately vague, to give you practice in reading through instructions, trying things out, solving problems collaboratively, and getting guidance from documentation).

The owner of the code (the Navigator) then goes to their GitHub repo for the project and accepts the pull request. After that, in terminal on their laptop, while in the game directory, enter the command ‘git pull origin main’ to retrieve the modified code from GitHub.

When everything is finished for one person’s project, submit the links for the last pull request made from the Driver to the Navigator (in both cases) in the Canvas assignment.

4. Pair Programming Basics
In pair programming, there are two developers working on a single body of code on a single computer.
One member of the pair is the Driver, and this person will be the one doing all of the actual typing work on the laptop. The Driver will be working on the Navigator’s code by way of forking and cloning the Navigator’s repository.
The other member of the pair is the Navigator, and this person will work with only their voice and their thoughts.
The Navigator does not touch the keyboard, nor does the Navigator work on their laptop “on the side”. The Navigator is fully engaged with the work that the pair is doing, typically using a piece of scratch paper to sketch diagrams, take notes, or list ideas. At most the Navigator uses their laptop to perhaps keep a copy of this assignment document open or to look up something needed to write the code, such as a reference page like MDN.
Under no circumstances does the Navigator work on any code on their laptop: for the pair programming process to be effective, both parties must be fully engaged on the code they’re working on together.
The lab time should be divided into two sections of approximately two hours each. At the halfway mark, you should swap roles and work on the other person’s code. Remember to watch the clock and determine the best point to swap roles.
In the case of an odd number of students, one group will have three members and you should rotate through three roles: Driver, Navigator, Observer. Each person should take on each role one time. You will need to be even more mindful about watching the clock to ensure that equal time is devoted to all three projects.
Stretch Goals
Work from collections of like data: Create 3 arrays, one for each of: your questions, the correct answers, and the two possible responses. (The same applies if you’ve added in any other pieces to the questions besides the most basic structure.) Replace that content in the functions by accessing the arrays.

Make it DRY: Reduce the yes/no questions from five functions to one function, and then use a ‘for’ loop to iterate through the arrays and call the function for each question.

Code review: Take time to explore each other’s CSS and talk about how it is organized and what it is doing. Make suggestions for how it can be improved. Integrate your partner’s suggestions to improve your own styling.

Improve accessibility: Collaborate on achieving better scores on accessibility audits. Include a screenshot of your new audit score in your README.md file.

### Reflections and Comments

The most impactful way for me to learn is to learn things that will have an impact on my day to day. I originally got into coding due to the ability to automate my daily tasks at work to make more time for myself instead of doing very monotonous tasks. The same is true while at Code Fellows. Every time that I learn a new skill or ability and apply it right away, I learn that using what you learn right away is the best way to learn. Building upon my previous experiences has helped me to find the right thing that I need and can use to solve a problem. I find it applicable to most aspects of life in order to grow and learn. What I love the most is leaning form many different people because everyone has something they use that could be useful to you. Its really amazing to see the collaborative side of learning.
